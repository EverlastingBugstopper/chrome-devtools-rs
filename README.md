# Chrome Devtools Protocol Wrapper

⚠️ DO NOT USE THIS CRATE ⚠️

The API is extremely unstable, untested, and incomplete. There are a few other
crates in the ecosystem that likely better serve your needs.

## What's here so far

This repository is home to a wrapper for the
[Chrome Devtools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/)
written in Rust. It is a work in progress and does not cover all of the possible
message types that the protocol emits. If you would like to use this library but
it does not support a message type you need, feel free to open a PR.
