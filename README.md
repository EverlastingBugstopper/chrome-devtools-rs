# Chrome Devtools Protocol Wrapper

This repository is home to a wrapper for the [Chrome Devtools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/) written in Rust. It is a work in progress and does not cover all of the possible message types that the protocol emits. If you would like to use this library but it does not support a message type you need, feel free to open a PR.
